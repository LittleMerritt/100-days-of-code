# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up Python environment - made it to page 27 of book.

**Thoughts:** The first hurdle of committing to it is over.  Now to keep it up.


### Day 2: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Spyder & PyCharm.  Finished Chapter 2 of Python Book.  

**Thoughts**: Confused about can you run scripts for ArcPro from alternate IDE, or do you have to run geoprocessing scripts form the python window within ArcPro?  TWeeting gives me anxiety.

### Day 3: July 28, 2020 2)

**Today's Progress**: Only made it 40 mins before interrupted by work, then dog in that order.  Worked through Chapter 3 of the python book.

**Thoughts**: This chapter is mostly about geoprocessing within pro - familiar stuff to me. Had a hard time focussing.
