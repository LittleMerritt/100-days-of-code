### Day 1: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up Python environment - made it to page 27 of book.

**Thoughts:** The first hurdle of committing to it is over.  Now to keep it up.


### Day 2: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Spyder & PyCharm.  Finished Chapter 2 of Python Book.  

**Thoughts**: Confused about can you run scripts for ArcPro from alternate IDE, or do you have to run geoprocessing scripts form the python window within ArcPro?  TWeeting gives me anxiety.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
